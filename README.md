###### CRYPTOBITES

# CyptoBites strives to provide accurate, timely, and unbiased data for crypto assets.  This is a Django web application for the data related to cryptocurrency. Our view is that the user can know what the current price of crypto currency is and can draw conclusions accordingly. We have added five models; Recommendations, Tutorial, Testimonials, Buy Coins and Coins which will give users an idea whatâ€™s happening in the market and even help users with what is cryptocurrency, etc. by watching the tutorials. The database is handled by admins whose responsibility is to add, update or delete any information as required.



# Hence, our website contains list of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on with their rates and certain fluctuations in the rates. It also depicts the recommended cryptocurrencies using graphs.
